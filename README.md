A cool little script that fetches a random ascii art from www.asciiur.com and prints it!

The code randonmly selects a tag from search_tags and pulls random art from the first page of search results. It also filters the art based on width and height. 

This script would work really well as a splash screen for SSH logins, bash, zsh, or emacs. Maybe I'll do that in the future!

Example output:

`user@hostname# python3 dashcii.py                                                                                                                                                 ─╯
